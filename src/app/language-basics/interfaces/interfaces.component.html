  <h2>Interfaces</h2>  
  <hr>  
  <p>One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have. 
    This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural subtyping”. In TypeScript, interfaces fill 
    the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as 
    well as contracts with code outside of your project. As it done in many other languages containing 
    interfaces Typescript's interfaces might have whether optional or readonly properties as well as 
    function declarations. Here is a sample of usage interfaces that contain all mentioned features:</p>
  <div *ngFor="let codeSample of codeSamples">
    <div class="code-place">
      <pre>{{codeSample}}</pre>
    </div>
    <br>
  </div>
